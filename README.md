**Witching Hour Works, an informal collaboration by Misha Mayeur and Joe Cantu, would like to submit for consideration the following proposal for an interactive exhibit to join the ranks of the 2023 Supernova event on the Lafitte Greenway. 

Our Light-based installation will offer a stellated incorporation celebrating the agriculture bearers of the land we call home: native wildflower species from the New Orleans biosphere, while inviting residents to dance in the ambience of colored light, floral pattern, and seeds for radiant repatriation.**

#A magnificent star hangs in the sky: a cosmic dancer, waiting for you to dance with her. She beams to light your way. A Little Free Seed Library gleams in the dark, filled with potential and inspiration. Highlighting native flora and the different moons of the Chocktaw tribe, Star Seeds serves as a hub for knowledge and communal sharing, connecting us to the land of the greenway and those who came before, while the star's comforting glow lights the way.
